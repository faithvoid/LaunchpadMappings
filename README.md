# Custom modes and DAW (Traktor/Mixxx/Bitwig) mappings for the Novation Launchpad MK2 / X / Mini.

## DJ Mode
A custom-made set of mappings and custom modes for use as a DJ controller in Traktor & Mixxx.
"DJ Main" controls the primary mixer functions (play/cue/pause, cue points, fast forward/rewind, pitch up/down, track volume) and "DJ EQ" controls Hi-Mid-Low ends + Super FX knobs.

#### Known Issues:
When setting a slider back to it's default state, you'll need to tap on the last pressed pad 4 times to get it exactly in the middle. To my knowledge there isn't a workaround for this, so keep it in mind when adjusting the EQ/FX on a track.
